**Report on Vision Transformer Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification**

## Introduction
Hyperspectral image classification plays a crucial role in remote sensing and various other fields, where precise spectral analysis is required. In this project, a Vision Transformer (ViT) model was implemented to classify hyperspectral images. The model was trained, validated, and tested on a dataset to evaluate its performance in terms of accuracy and loss.

## Model Details
- **Architecture:** Vision Transformer (ViT)
- **Device Used:** CPU
- **Training Epochs:** 20
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy and Loss

## Training and Validation Performance
The model was trained for 20 epochs, and its performance improved significantly over time. Below are the key training and validation metrics:

| Epoch | Train Loss | Train Acc | Val Loss | Val Acc |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1     | 1.8501    | 0.3653    | 1.7433   | 0.4104  |
| 5     | 1.2981    | 0.4860    | 1.3152   | 0.4896  |
| 10    | 0.6688    | 0.7436    | 0.5778   | 0.8006  |
| 15    | 0.2666    | 0.9072    | 0.3472   | 0.8646  |
| 20    | 0.1942    | 0.9328    | 0.1878   | 0.9268  |

The training loss consistently decreased while the training accuracy improved, indicating effective learning. Similarly, the validation loss decreased, and validation accuracy increased, reaching a final accuracy of **92.68%**.

## Test Performance
After training, the model was evaluated on the test set, achieving:
- **Test Loss:** 0.1804
- **Test Accuracy:** **93.07%**

## Analysis
1. **Steady Improvement:** The training and validation accuracy consistently improved across epochs, indicating effective learning.
2. **Overfitting Prevention:** The validation loss closely followed the training loss, suggesting minimal overfitting.
3. **High Final Accuracy:** The test accuracy of **93.07%** demonstrates the modelâ€™s strong classification capability.
4. **Possible Enhancements:**
   - **Hyperparameter tuning** to optimize learning rate, batch size, and transformer depth.
   - **Data Augmentation** to improve model generalization.
   - **GPU Acceleration** for faster training and potential performance improvements.

## Conclusion
The Vision Transformer model successfully classified hyperspectral images with high accuracy. With further optimizations and computational enhancements, its performance can be further improved for real-world applications.
